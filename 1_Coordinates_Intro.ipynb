        "Astronomers use a wide variety of coordinate systems and formats to represent sky coordinates of celestial objects. For example, you may have seen terms like \"right ascension\" and \"declination\" or \"galactic latitude and longitude,\" and you may have seen angular coordinate components represented as \"0h39m15.9s,\" \"00:39:15.9,\" or 9.81625º. The subpackage `astropy.coordinates` provides tools for representing the coordinates of objects and transforming them between different systems. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will explore how the `astropy.coordinates` package can be used to work with astronomical coordinates. You may find it helpful to keep [the Astropy documentation for the coordinates package](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html) open alongside this tutorial for reference or additional reading. In the text below, you may also see some links that look like ([docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html)).

While `Quantity` ([docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html)) is a general class that represents numerical values and physical units of any kind, `astropy.coordinates` defines subclasses of `Quantity` that are specifically designed for working with angles, such as the `Angle` ([docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.Angle.html)) class. The `Angle` class then has additional, more specialized subclasses `Latitude` ([docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.Latitude.html)) and `Longitude` ([docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.Longitude.html)). These objects store angles, provide useful attributes to quickly convert to common angular units, and enable formatting the numerical values in various formats.

        "\n",
        "So far, we have used `SkyCoord` to represent angular sky positions (i.e., `ra` and `dec` only). It is sometimes useful to include distance information with the sky coordinates of a source, thereby specifying the full 3D position of an object. To pass in distance information, `SkyCoord` accepts the keyword argument \"`distance`\". So, if we knew that the distance to NGC 188 is 1.96 kpc, we could also pass in a distance (as a `Quantity` object) using this argument:"

For a precisely-measured parallax $\\varpi$, the distance $d$ to a star can be obtained approximately as $d \\approx 1/\\varpi$. This only really works if the parallax error is small relative to the parallax ([see discussion in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02105)), so if we want to use these parallaxes to get distances we first have to filter out stars that have low signal-to-noise parallaxes:"

        "In this tutorial, we have introduced `astropy.coordinates` as a way to store and represent astronomical sky coordinates. We used coordinate objects, via the `SkyCoord` class interface, to parse and change coordinate representations and units. We also demonstrated how to use a `SkyCoord` object with the `astroquery` package to query an astronomical database, the *Gaia* science archive. We then created a single `SkyCoord` object with the queried data that represents the sky coordinates of many objects. Finally, we introduced the concept of using `astropy.coordinates` to represent a 3D position of an object or set of objects."
